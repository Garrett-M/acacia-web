            <h2>Rush Acacia</h2>
            <p>
                Acacia is a unique fraternity. We were recolonized at UW
                in 2014 and have grown rapidly since. While we're nearing our
                charter, Acacia is still expanding quickly and that brings
                about a variety of opportunities that simply do not exist in
                other fraternities. Leadership opportunities present themselves
                from the first quarter of active membership, in addition to
                many opportunities for personal and academic growth over one's
                college career.
            </p>

            <h2>The Pledge Process</h2>
            <p>
                Pledging is first and foremost a process of familiarity. It is
                a time for a pledge to learn more about the fraternity and its
                members and for the members to learn more about the pledge. If,
                after the pledge process, an individual feels the fraternity
                is still a good fit and the members feel similarly, the pledge
                will then transition into active membership.
            </p>
            <p>
                Acacia is a strictly non-hazing fraternity. Hazing is explicitly
                forbidden in the Laws of Acacia. We strive to create a positive
                environment for our men to grow: one of respect and dignity.
